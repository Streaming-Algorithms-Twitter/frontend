### Getting Started:
You need to install python 3, along with flask, flash_restful, and flask-cors (to run alongside a localhost client):
```
pip install flask
pip install flask-restful
pip install flask-cors
python endpoint.py
```
Hit the intended rest endpoints by using the port 5000 (http://localhost:5000/)
