### Getting Started Back-end:
### Getting Started
You need to install python 3, along with flask, flash_restful, and flask-cors (to run alongside a localhost client):
```
pip install flask
pip install flask-restful
pip install flask-cors
python endpoint.py
```
Hit the intended rest endpoints by using the port 5000 (http://localhost:5000/)

### Getting Started Front-end:
You need to install the Angular CLI:
```
npm install -g @angular/cli
cd twitter-streaming-app
ng serve
```
Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
